ReadNovelFull Scraper Instructions

1. Entry Point

URL: Accept the base novel URL (e.g., https://readnovelfull.com/shadow-slave.html).

2. Chapter Listing Extraction

Locate Container: Select the <div> with id="list-chapter".

List Blocks: Inside this div, find all <ul class="list-chapter"> elements.

Chapter Elements: For each <ul>, iterate over its <li> children.

Extract Link and Title:

URL: Read the href attribute of the <a> inside each <li>.

Title: Read the text content of that <a>.

3. Chapter Page Extraction

Navigate: Request the chapter page URL obtained above.

Locate Content Block: Select the <div id="chr-content">.

Extract Title: Grab the <h3> text inside this div.

Extract Body:

Collect all <p> elements within div#chr-content.

Filter: Omit any <p> whose only content is a <strong> tag (commonly ads).

For remaining <p> tags, strip any <strong> wrappers around inline text but keep the text inside.

4. Politeness & Error Handling

Robots.txt: Check and respect the site’s robots.txt before scraping.

Rate Limiting: Add delays (e.g., 1–2 seconds) between requests to avoid overloading the server.

Retries: On HTTP 5xx errors, retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff.

Logging:

Log unexpected HTML changes or missing elements for review.

Record timestamps and URLs of each request.

5. Integration Notes

Apply the same request/session management and parsing utilities and file management as in /webscrapers/lightNovelPubDotVip/genChaptersV2.py.

Ensure output format matches existing pipeline expectations (e.g., JSON with chapters: [{title, url, content}]).
