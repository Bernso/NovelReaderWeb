                <br>
                As the sword arced towards me, I noticed that it had a faint glow of mana surrounding it . Augmenting his sword to attack an eight-year-old… this guy really showed no tact . The hood covering the guard's face was blown back as he charged towards me, revealing a rugged veteran's furious expression .<br>Faces of horror could be seen clearly from those around us . The Twin Horns desperately tried to make their way towards the guard when they saw him attack me, to stop him from cleaving me in two . Even the King looked surprised at the unprecedented action of his guard, while the Queen had already frantically started reaching for her wand .<br>My eyes stayed focused on the guard that was about to swing down, but I was quite relaxed . Whether or not it was because he was angry, or because the training the royal guards received was mediocre, his attack was rushed and full of openings . I didn't even need to will mana into my body to deal with him . I took a step forward with my right foot as his sword swung down towards me, then reached up and grabbed the space on the grip of his sword between the cross-guard and his hand .<br>I proceeded to pivot on my right foot, using the momentum of his swing, while my body was parallel to the guard's . His reinforced sword whistled harmlessly through the empty space where I'd just been, creating a small fissure in the ground, and conversely embedding his sword in it . In one smooth movement, I quickly struck him in the jaw, which he hadn't bothered to guard with mana . The force of my upward punch, combined with his downward movement from his swing, created an impact much stronger than I'd expected . The guard only managed to let out a low grunt before he crumpled to the ground .<br>My attention immediately focused, then, to Sebastian . As I had expected, the dense fool was silently muttering a spell as his beady eyes locked intently with mine .<br>SEBASTIAN'S POV:<br>'That impudent brat! He needs to learn his place! When the King asks for something, it isn't a request; it's an order! How dare he not only refuse, but also reprimand our noble King! That brat doesn't deserve his equals contract! I personally come from a family of pure conjurers; elite mages capable of bending nature to their will . I don't have a contract with a beast at all! Yet, that brat has a beast that was capable enough to form an equals contract at such a young age! That means that the beast's level is least A class!' I couldn't help but grind my teeth in frustration .<br>'I'm the one that deserves the magnificent steed that that beast will grow to become! And yet, he refused me? He refused the King?'<br>"Insolent peasant! You dare insult the King and his family?" Harry let out a roar as he charged towards the brat, his sword brandished high up in the air .<br>'Yes! Kill that brat! I guess augmenters do have their uses at times . Hahaha! After that brat's dead, that black mana beast will rightfully be mine!'<br>Yet, before I could even start cheering for him, he'd been knocked out .<br>"…"<br>'What the hell? How did that useless, half-witted fool manage to knock himself out? Ugh… I guess I'll have to handle this brat by myself . ' As I began taking out my staff, I noticed the brat walking towards me .<br>I had to hold back a laugh . 'He's actually come towards me? Is he asking to die?' Well, I didn't really care at this point . That non-mage 'Vincent' was a close friend of the King, but I'll probably just get off with a light punishment for killing an insignificant brat .<br>Whatever bothersome punishment he served me would be well worth it after getting my hands on the brat's mana beast .<br>As I began silently chanting a spell, I couldn't help but grow irritated as he continued to approach me . Was he such a fool that he couldn't tell that he was about to die?<br>However, a twinge of unease began forming at the pit of my stomach . This boy, no background or power to save him, had such confidence . Why did I feel like this brat, who's only half my height, was somehow looking down at me; as if he was the one that was superior .<br>However, much stronger than my unease was harsh contempt for having something that I had been searching so hard for . 'You're just trying to make me want to kill you more, aren't you, brat?'<br>He arrived in front of me just as I was about to finish my Fire Spark spell .<br>All of a sudden, a piercing crunch sounded from beneath me before I dropped to my knees . " . . . "<br>'That's weird . Why did I suddenly lose balance?'<br>I glanced down, only to see someone's knee bent inwards, along with the bones, tendons still attached, sticking out of the skin .<br>'T-t-that's my leg!'<br> "GAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!"<br>"M-MY LEG! MY LEG!! AHHHHHHHH!"<br>IT HURTS! IT HURTS IT HURTS IT HURTS IT HURTS IT HURTS IT HURTS IT HURTS! I've never felt such excruciating pain in my life! Why should a noble conjurer like myself need to feel pain?<br>'W-Why is no-one helping me?' As I frantically looked around, it was apparent that everyone was somehow frozen . They weren't just surprised, but actually frozen in place .<br>It was then that I noticed that the colors of my surrounding had been flipped, or reversed . 'Have my eyes been clouded from the pain?'<br>"This space won't last long, so I'll make it quick . I'll tell you rightnow that it would be best for both of us if you stopped your hopeless pursuit of my bond . I don't wish to make an enemy of this Kingdom's leader, thus I'm giving you one last chance . "<br>The boy was speaking in a manner that made me completely forget his age . The tone of his words, coupled with the way he articulated them, carried both power and dignity, caused a terrifying sensation that I had felt before .<br>'It was him back in the room!' As I thought this, the pressure bore down on me, forcing me to fearfully comply .<br>He turned his back to me as he walked away, taking a few steps forward, before suddenly glancing back at me .<br>He looked at me with an emotionless face, his eyes seeming to pierce straight into my brain like a hot needle, actually making me wince in pain .<br>'No… No, no, no . . . I can't breathe! I-I'm scared!' The torturous pain had been somewhat numbed . Instead, I could feel a warm sensation between my legs as my body accepted its fate of death .<br>His eyes continued to bore down at me in blatant disgust as I tried to stop my body from shivering .<br>He looked at me as if I was simply an insect, and slowly mouthed,<br>"Know . Your . Place . "<br>KING GLAYDER'S POV:<br>While the implication of his message towards the King of a country was provoking, this eight-year-old's reasoning and argument fascinated me .<br>Even though Sebastian was a loyal guard that had served us for decades, it was beneath me to make this kid give up his pet . And yet, I still promised him beforehand that I would . Who would I be if I were to go back on my word?Then, everything went south . 'Do the Royal Knight Guards only amount to this much…? To rush in simply because of an eight-year-old's provocation?'<br>I didn't bring my personal Templar Knights, thinking that there wouldn't be any trouble, but I couldn't have guessed that these fresh trainees would cause this much trouble . . .<br>Although it surprised me, I quickly composed myself . What's done is done . If a royal guard was to kill this child, the public might pity him and his family for a couple of days, but ultimately the fault would lie in the child's parents for getting in my way .<br>It was a pity that this kid's family was friends with Vincent . Cutting ties with the auction house owner may turn out to be . . . a bit inconvenient, in the future .<br>Yet, outside of all expectations, the eight-year-old displayed a series of movements that couldn't be more impeccably executed even if a Tempar Knight had done it . So deftly did the boy knock out my Royal Guardsman .<br>'Harry, you fool . How inexperienced do you have to be that you even forgot to reinforce your body?! The only thing you're doing is give a bad name to the Royal Knights of Sapin!'<br>"KYYAAAAAAAAAA!" I instantly turned my head in the direction of the shrill scream .<br>My wife was staring wide-eyed at something behind me, causing me to turn around to get a better look .<br>'How is Sebastian, who was fine just a second ago, now on the ground clutching his left leg like that? His leg has several shards of bone sticking out, yet he's just glaring daggers at the boy?'<br>The conjurer fumbled for his staff on the ground and as soon as he grabbed it, pointed it at the boy while starting to mumble a spell .<br>"Enough, Sebastian!" I roared at him . Did this ignorant fool not know that all of this stemmed from his greed for a child's bond?<br>I grabbed his staff and snapped it in half . Sebastian just looked at me in shock—as if I'd betrayed him .<br>This pathetic ingrate…<br>"Stand down! This matter is over," I growled menacingly at him as we locked eyes .<br>'He is in the presence of a King! No matter how much he has gotten used to it, it's best that I remind him that I can end his life on a whim . '<br>As soon as I finished this thought, the boy fainted . His family and, what I can only assume were his friends, immediately rushed towards him . I sighed . 'Settling this incident will be rather tiring . '<br>I could see that the boy's family and friends were struggling not to lash out at me .<br>'How wise of them to know their place in front of their King . '<br>Thinking about the trouble this had caused, and what it will take to deal with it, I let out a deep breath .<br>"I imagine that that boy needs to be treated; please excuse yourselves so that we can settle this matter another time," I announced as I guided my wife and children outside, leaving the two pathetic clowns that I'd been foolish enough to once call Royal Knights to be picked up by his teammates . ARTHUR LEYWIN'S POV:<br>'Gah! My head!'<br>I pried open my eyes, curious as to where I was, but everything was blurry . As my vision slowly cleared, I carefully turned my head to the right and to the left .<br>It was my room .<br>"Kyu!" Sylvie woke up almost immediately and began licking my face . 'You're awake! You're awake!' she chirped, her tail wagging fiercely .<br>"Mmm . . . ? Oh, you're finally awake!" My mom had her head in her arms as she leaned on my bed .<br>"The doctor said that you probably fell unconscious from shock, and that you'd wake up soon . However, I didn't think 'soon' would be eight hours . " She ran her fingers gently through my hair, giving me a soft smile .<br>It was evident from her red eyes that she'd been crying for a while . A bitter taste filled my mouth in regret from making her worry again<br>"What happened after I passed out?" I willed myself to sit up, placing the excited Sylvie on my lap .<br>"We all left shortly after you fell unconscious . No one was in their right state of mind, thus the King excused himself first . Your father is downstairs with the King's representative . They're in the living room discussing what happened . " Her eyes quivered in worry .<br>I simply nodded in response and got out of bed . My body still felt heavy from using the first phase of Sylvia's Draconic Will, so I limped slowly downstairs with Mother after she checked in on Ellie, who was asleep in her room .<br>As we made our way downstairs, I could hear my father, along with an elderly man's hoarse voice .<br>Upon seeing me, the representative suddenly stood up, giving me a slight bow, a bit of a relieved look on his weathered face . My father's back was facing me, so he only turned to look when he saw the old man start to get up .<br>"My son! You're awake!" He hurled himself over the couch and wrapped me in a bear hug, his hand cupping the back of my head .<br>"Yeah Dad, I'm fine . What're you guys talking about?"<br>"This representative came by with a few gold coins as a 'token of apology' from the King . 'For the small incident'," my father answered through clenched teeth .<br>"The Royal King has also ordered me to inform the Leywin family that both guards that attacked Arthur Leywin have been stripped of nobility," the representative added, his voice cracking .<br>"For almost killing my son, the King just gave them a slap on the wrist, and then waved them goodbye?" My father couldn't help but be livid from the frustration .<br>"Father, it's all right! Look, I wasn't hurt . Let's just end this matter . " I squeezed my father's hand, giving him a reassuring look .<br>The King seemed like a decent enough character, but in times like this, I guess his priorities lie elsewhere .<br>The representative just looked at us matter-of-factly—as if it was a given that whatever the King had done was the right thing .<br>Letting out a sigh, I took a seat . 'I'm too tired for this crap . '<br>Casting aside the issue, I asked about Sebastian, in case he'd said anything . "What happened to that Conjurer? The one who had his knee broken?"<br>The representative just shook his head a little . "We don't know . Our experts hypothesized that it was due to the mana that the Knight attacked you with ricocheting and hitting his knee . "<br>I just shrugged at this . Looks like the matter was settled more easily than I had expected .<br>After the elderly representative left—mainly because my father had grown impatient with his attitude—he turned around and gave me a grin .<br>"Good job knocking out that Augmenter . That's my son!" He put his fist out in front of him, which I promptly pounded with my own fist, smiling .<br>"Where are the Twin Horns anyway? I thought they'd be here . "<br>My mother answered me while chuckling, "We had to keep them away from this, otherwise they might've really turned into wanted criminals . "<br>I laughed at this, but I could tell that it was something they were genuinely worried about by the helpless look on my father's face .<br>According to my mother, the Twin Horns were waiting at a nearby Inn . My father told me that we'd head out there tomorrow for breakfast, and would discuss me being an adventurer with them . I nodded at this and went back into my room . My birthday was in less than two weeks . I'd finally be able to make my first mark here in this world .<br>As I sunk back down in my bed, I stared at the palms of my hands, idly thinking about the events from earlier . This was the first time I'd used Sylvia's Draconic Will . These past years that I had spent studying Sylvie's will, before assimilating it into my body and practicing it for four months, had caused me to sigh in wonder at just how powerful Sylvia was .<br>I was just tapping into the ocean that was Sylvia's powers . Unlike Grandpa Virion, who could only get a speed boost and blend into his surroundings, being a legacy tamer allowed me to access a lot more of Sylvia's powers at stage one .<br>What I had used on Sebastian was something that I decided to named 'Distortion' . I could basically separate myself from time and space for a brief moment . Although I couldn't alter anything around me, it did give me time to assess my situation . Earlier today, I'd exceeded my limits by using Distortion on another person as well . This had allowed me to get by unnoticed from the King—for now . I wasn't strong enough to act against him yet .<br>My current limit with Distortion, before I received any backlash, was two seconds . However today, I had used it on another person, as well as had prolonged it to five seconds . I'd done all that just to scare that bug named Sebastian . I'd used up all of my mana and passed out for half a day—just to terrify a bug . Maybe it would've been better to kill him .<br>No, I couldn't think like that anymore . Causing meaningless deaths just for my convenience wasn't something that I should do in this world . I needed to be different in this world .<br>I shook my head . I had a lot of time . Since I had so much time, I needed to be patient .<br>I unwrapped the package that Vincent had left beside my bed, only to see a completely white mask that was able to cover my entire face . It was a simple mask, with two sharp eye slits that curved upwards; it reminded me of a fox's eyes . There was no nose or mouth hole; just a singular blue streak that ran straight down the left side of the mask, through the left eye slit .<br>I tried the mask on, which somehow stuck to my face without the need of a strap . I also tried on the midnight blue coat, which turned out to be a little long . After strapping on the coat, it suddenly shrunk to fit my body perfectly .<br>I couldn't help but be embarrassed; I felt like some sort of wannabe assassin or vigilante .<br>"Ahh, ahh . Testing . Testing . " The tone of my voice surprised me . It sounded completely different . My immature, high-pitched voice had become a rich, baritone .<br>"Kuu?" Sylvie just looked at me curiously, causing me to laugh and take off my getup .<br><div class='adsbox'><span class="adlbl"><small>s</small></div>"Aren't you excited? Don't you want to get a little bit of action as well, Sylv?" I patted her head, as my head swam with images of being an adventurer .
