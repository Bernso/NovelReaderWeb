                TESSIA ERALITH'S POV:<br>I kissed him… I k-kissed him!<br>As I ran out of the room, I could feel the temperature in my face rising rapidly . That was my first k-kiss! I wonder if he liked it? Did I do it right? My face didn't look weird as I kissed him r-right?<br>I stopped in the hall and looked at my reflection in the window . I stood right in front of it and pretended to kiss Art again to see how I'd looked . <br>"EEK! NOOO!!" Banging my head on the window in embarrassment, I could only groan at the thought of how weird I must've looked to him . As I looked outside through the window with my forehead still glued against it, I touched my lips with my fingers . <br>His lips sure were soft . They were a bit chapped since he was so hurt but it felt nice . <br>"Hehe…"<br>I noticed that my face in the reflection showed a perverted grin . <br>Oh God, I'm turning into a pervert . I wonder if I came on too strong? What if he didn't like it? What if he thinks I'm some sort of pervert now?<br>"UGHHH!" I slumped down to my knees as my forehead slid down the window . <br>Wait . How was I supposed to face him now? Things were just getting better too! Did I just ruin everything? What if he ignored me now, when he saw me?<br>A throbbing ache thumped in my chest as tears started welling up in the corners of my eyes . I wouldn't be able to bear it if Art ignored me like that . <br>Should I go back to his room and pretend it was all a joke? I imagined myself bursting in the room, laughing and pointing at him . "Got you! Hahaha! You really fell for it!"Am I stupid? I groaned again at the stupidity of it all . <br>No! You did the right thing, Tess! Things would never progress if I left it up to Art! He still treats me like a child every time we're together . It was for the best!<br>"Yeah!" I fist pumped the air to encourage myself but I still let out a big sigh at the thought of him not liking me . <br>"Tch!" Who cares?! If that stupid Art chooses to ignore me, I can just find someone better than him! He wasn't that great anyway! He's just a teeny bit better-looking than average . He's only slightly better than mediocre in magic, right?<br>Sigh . Who was I kidding? I couldn't imagine myself with anyone else but Arthur . Sure, over the years, there were nobles that tried to impress me and tried to get close but they didn't come close to Arthur . <br>That stupid Art! He's such a player! "'Don't furrow your brows, Tess . Your face will turn ugly,'<br>" I said in a mocking tone, imitating him . <br>Tch! Making my heart skip a beat for no reason! That stupid player!<br>"GAH! Who cares if he doesn't like you, Tess! It's his loss! What don't you have? You're a talented mage! You're also pretty smart and popular too, right? Not to sound conceited but you're not a bad-looking girl either, right? Arthur is the one that's missing out if he doesn't snatch you up!" I pointed at my reflection as if she's a different person . <br>I wondered what kind of excuses I could make to talk to Arthur . There were plenty of excuses! His Mother personally asked me to watch over him, yeah! A-And also, the beast core assimilation! I could just ask him to help me with it since he was the one that gave me the beast core! It was only right that he took the responsibility, right?<br>Sigh…<br>I took one last look back at where Arthur's room was before I slumped back to my dorm . <br>ARTHUR LEYWIN'S POV:I k-kissed Tess…<br>I kissed Tessia Eralith, a thirteen-year-old girl . Wasn't this a crime? Was I a criminal? No, I had to calm down . I was in the body of a twelve-year-old boy . Why did I feel so guilty then? I shouldn't, right?<br>She was the one that kissed me after all! I was the victim here! Making a move on me while I was in this vulnerable state . . . he sure was smart, that Tess . As I stared blankly at the door she'd left through, my shaking hand finally reached my lips and I just lay there, dumbfounded, touching my mouth as my mind couldn't help but recall the soft, moist touch of her lips . <br>This was wrong . Yes, I was technically only twelve years old, but with the mental age from my previous life and this life combined, I was almost 50! Even assuming that I had kids late, Tess would still be around the age of a daughter if I'd had one . <br>Goddammit! All of this was because of this accursed body! These raging hormones in my body right now! The reason I was feeling so guilty was because I actually enjoyed it . It felt nice when Tess kissed me . It shouldn't feel nice and I shouldn't enjoy a kiss from a little girl, but I did . <br>I groaned, half from pain and the other half from thinking about what was going to happen between Tess and I . Knowing her, she was probably over-thinking a lot of things right now and she was going to be really uncomfortable around me . <br>I almost laughed at the thought of what people might think of Tess when she was with me . If someone didn't know any better, they might even assume that she hated me since she was the type to act cold when she didn't know what to do . <br>Something told me that if I didn't clear things up with her, there would only be more misunderstandings . <br>How should I clear things up though? It's not like she confessed or anything . Should we date? No, no, no . Did kids our age even know what dating was?<br>I looked back and thought of the time when I was twelve in my past life . When I was twelve, my life was filled with only training . Being raised in an orphanage and getting sent to an institute solely dedicated to raising duelists, I couldn't say that I really had any experience dating . <br>We were too young anyhow, right? I was technically only twelve in this body! Was this body even capable of reproducing yet? Oh God, now you're overthinking this, Arthur . <br>Haa… it wasn't like I hated Tess . I was actually quite fond of her . She was still immature in some senses, but I shouldn't let that be an excuse right?<br>"What do you think, Sylv?" I poked my sleeping bond as her body slowly heaved up and down with her breaths . I was surprised she hadn't woken up when Tess kissed me . As I played with my bond's ears and paws, my breaths began to synchronize with hers, and I soon fell asleep . <br>_________________________________________<br>Over the past couple of days, quite a few people came to visit me while my body was recovering . Curtis came by and asked if I was okay . I only shot him a grin and said that his move was pretty damn strong, making him laugh . Claire Bladeheart also stopped by to check on me and kept me up-to-date committee meetings so I wouldn't be totally lost when I went back . <br>To my surprise, Kathyln came by herself instead of with her brother . She asked if I was okay and I swore, she had a worried expression on her face . I was more surprised by that than anything else . I could tell everyone had a lot of questions . Curtis looked like he wanted to ask me something a few times but he held back because of my condition . Even Professor Glory came to visit, with basket of fruits in hand . <br>"I'll tell you now, Lucas has been pretty heated up in class . I can't blame him, though . To him, it must've felt like he was beating you in every sense, but you suddenly disappeared and appeared a few hundred meters away instantly . " She paused before continuing . "H-How did you do it anyways? I've never seen anything like that . You should know that even Director Goodsky isn't capable of what you just did . Instant teleportation was always thought of to be a myth . Yet, here you are, a twelve-year-old . . . "<br>By this time, I was able to sit up without it hurting that much, so I lifted myself up just enough to be at eye-level with the seated Professor Glory . <br>"Growth isn't stopped by a lack of talent or a series of unfortunate luck . Growth is stopped once the person limits his own ability to grow . With that said, I believe everyone has a secret or two they wish to keep to themselves . " I sunk back down in my bed, leaving Professor Glory confused and without a means to respond . <br>Director Goodsky visited once . I asked what was happening to the class I was supposed to be teaching and they said that, for now, Professor Glory volunteered to take on the extra class as a substitute until I was better . She didn't stay for long and came mainly to update me on how Tess was doing . <br>"As her assimilation continues, she's becoming more and more stable . These past couple of days, she has only had one more fit," she stated . <br>"Thanks for taking care of her, Director . " I gave her a smile . <br>"Don't thank me, Arthur . She is my precious disciple, after all . Ahh, that reminds me . I will be out of the academy for a couple days on some business . Since Virion has gone back, I need you to help Tessia with her assimilation until I am back . Can you do that for me?" she said, not waiting for an answer before leaving through the door, as if the question was a mere formality . <br>"Uh, yeah . S-Sure, I can do that . " I shook my head helplessly at this . I wasn't sure if Director Goodsky really has errands to run but she was definitely giving me an excuse to meet Tess . <br>My body's recovery rate was a lot faster thanks to the assimilation of Sylvia's Dragon Will into my muscles and bones . I also spent this time while recovering to meditate and develop my mana core . I was at the threshold of breaking out of the dark yellow stage but it would take a bit more time until I could reach solid yellow . I would still feel a bit weak, but thankfully I planned on leaving the infirmary and resuming normal school life starting tomorrow . My body felt stiff from being in bed for so long . <br>Hearing a strong knock on the door, I called, "Come in . " I turned my head as Sylvie hopped off the bed and padded towards the door . <br>"I came to visit you!" My father had a wide grin on his face as soon as he noticed how much better I looked than before . <br>"Hey, Dad . " I smiled back as Sylvie 'kyus' in greeting before hopping back up next to me . <br>Taking a seat, my father caught me up on everything going on at home . We talked for quite a bit of time and I realized how comfortable it was to talk to my father . Family sure was different than anyone else . The fact that he didn't have any ulterior motives, no plan, no secrets, was comforting . He just wanted what was best for me . <br>After a brief period of silence, I asked him something that had been bothering me . "Hey, Dad . How come Mom never really uses her magic? I mean, she healed small wounds for me when I was little and stuff, but that was about it . I remember you telling me how great of an emitter she was . "<br>Looking at my father, I was surprised that his usual bright face turned a little sullen . <br>"Your mother . . . she carries a lot of weight in her heart . " Letting out a deep sigh, he continued . <br>"I know you're mature enough to know this but I want you to be patient . She'll tell you when she feels ready, so I want you to wait for her to tell you directly . " He ruffled before we changed topics . <br>"How's everyone doing at home anyway?" It hadn't been that long but it still felt like it'd been awhile since I'd spent some time with my family . <br>"Oh, you know, your mother is busy mingling with her friends . Your sister, though, she's becoming quite a handful . " He chuckles to himself . <br>"Maybe we had it too easy raising you, but I sometimes just don't know what to do with Ellie . " Scratching his head, I notice some wrinkles that hadn't been there before . <br>"Just give her some space . She'll come around . " Patting my father's arm weakly, I repositioned myself as I felt my body cramping up . <br>"I should let you rest, Son . " He pinched my nose softly and quietly left through the door, leaving me wondering what could possibly have happened with Mother that she became too traumatized to use her powers . <br>"Kyu?" Sylvie asked me what I was thinking of and I just shook my head . "It's nothing, Sylv . I hope . "
